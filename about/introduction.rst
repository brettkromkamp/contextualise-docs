Introduction
============

Welcome to the official documentation of `Contextualise <https://contextualise.dev/>`_, the simple and
flexible open source tool particularly suited for organising information-heavy projects and activities
consisting of unstructured and widely diverse data and information resources.

This page gives a broad presentation of Contextualise and of the contents of this documentation, so that
you know where to start if you are a beginner or where to look if you need info on a specific feature.

About Contextualise
-------------------

Contextualise is a versatile application that can be used in many different scenarios, including:

* Investigative journalism
* Personal knowledge management
* Research projects
* `Worldbuilding <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding>`_ and storytelling
* Conceptualisation
* `Mind gardening <https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden>`_ and networked thought

Contextualise's main dependency is `TopicDB <https://github.com/brettkromkamp/topic-db>`_, an open source
topic maps-based graph store. Topic maps provide a way to describe complex relationships between abstract
concepts and real-world (information) resources.
