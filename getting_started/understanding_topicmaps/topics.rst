Topics
======

A **topic** is... well anything, really. Examples of topics include you, your project, a company, a football club,
a specific interest, event, hobby or a person. Anything goes.

In practical terms (at least, in Contextualise), a topic is really nothing more than an identifier: something to
which you can connect (information) resources to, reference as part of a relationship between topics and attach meta
data to.

Finally, in topic maps terminology, the creation of a topic to represent an abstract concept is called *reification*.
